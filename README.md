## Installation

The code was tested with Matlab 2022a using Cpython 3.9.

Clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:Brain-Modulation-Lab/Paper_Vissani_et_al_OCDPercept.git
    
Requirements:
- Matlab wrapper for [FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof).

## Execution
Test if the code works in Matlab:

    Code1_plot_recordings.m

You need to include csv files and json Percepct recordings to run the script.
This should generate plots in the figures directory.
